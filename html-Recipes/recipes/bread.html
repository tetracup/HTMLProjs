        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p> 
            This is a delicious variation of the popular 
            tomato based appetizer. The strawberries are 
            warm and sweet and the sugar is caramelized 
            and crunchy! Your guests will love it! 
        </p>

        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        <ul> 
            <li>24 slices French baguette</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped fresh strawberries</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven's broiler. Spread a thin layer of butter 
                on each slice of bread. Arrange bread slices in a single 
                layer on a large baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li> 
                Place bread under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes, just until 
                lightly toasted. Spoon some chopped strawberries onto each 
                piece of toast, then sprinkle sugar over the strawberries.
            </li>
            <li> 
                Place under the broiler again until sugar is caramelized, 
                3 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
