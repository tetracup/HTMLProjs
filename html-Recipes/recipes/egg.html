            <h3> Description </h3>
            <p> 
                My children and husband go 
                nuts over these deviled eggs 
                with sour cream. I made them 
                for a potluck at work and 
                have been asked for them ever since. 
                (If you can keep people away from them, 
                you're doing better than I ever could.) 
                The time I spend prepping this depends on 
                how fast you shell your eggs. I have two girls, 
                so we knock this out in about 30 minutes '
                (minus cooking time).

            <h3> Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place eggs into a large pot and cover with lightly salted water. 
                    Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium; boil eggs for 10 to 12 
                    minutes.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Drain boiling water and fill the pot with cold water. 
                    Let eggs sit in cold water for 2 minutes, then pour off water 
                    and replace with more cold water. Repeat until eggs are 
                    thoroughly chilled, 10 to 15 minutes. Peel eggs; set aside.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Heat vegetable oil in a small skillet over medium heat; 
                    cook and stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. 
                    Remove from heat and let cool.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Slice eggs in half lengthwise and scoop yolks into a bowl; 
                    transfer egg white halves to a plate.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Mash egg yolks with a fork; stir in sour cream, mayonnaise, 
                    ranch dressing, Dijon mustard, garlic powder, onion powder, 
                    and lemon pepper seasoning until yolk mixture is smooth. 
                    Stir in saut√©ed onions, bacon bits, and Cheddar cheese.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Generously fill egg halves with filling and sprinkle 
                    each deviled egg with paprika. Refrigerate until chilled 
                    before serving.
